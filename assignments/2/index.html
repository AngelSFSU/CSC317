    Greetings! I am Angel Sandoval, a student at San Francisco State University. I am currently in my senior year at SFSU. I came to SFSU to major in computer science. I was always fascinated by how video games worked. So when I learned I can become a coder and write my own games, I decided to focus on computer science. Yet, my experience with it is limited. I only truly started to code about a year ago. The only language I know is Java as I used it on the IDE:Intellij. I strive to be able to create games that not only I like but others do as well. Along side that, Being able to work at home/anywhere would be nice. So I would not have to worry about vacations/lack of them. My hobby is playing video games.

            <h3>Project 1: BMI Calculator</h3>
            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>For this project we are asked to create a BMI Calculator. What is BMI? BMI is short for "Body Mass Index" and it weights a person usually in kilograms. We are asked to do the first set of code in imperial units. Once that is complete we are told to do another set of code using metric instead. 
            </p>
            <h4>Tech used:</h4>
            <p>The Technologies used for this project is Intellij, an IDE that uses the java language
            </p>
            <h4>Key Feature:</h4>
            <p>The main key feature of this project is the third set of code, which is a combination of the previous sets of code. Also known as the "Master Version." This version allows the user to either do imperial or metric calculation.
            </p>
            <h3>Project 2: SF Giants Thank You Card Orders</h3>
            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>For the second project we are hired by the San Francisco Giants to develop a messenger application to assist them with thank you card orders. We are asked that the thank you cards be in a specifc order and design. </p>
            <h4>Tech Utilized:</h4>
            <p>Along side Intellij, we also used wikipedia for the key feature.</p>
            <h4>Key Feature</h4>
            <p>The key feature for this project was allowing the student to choose which Giants player they wanted to chat with. We are told that Wikipedia is ok to use to choose the player. </p>
