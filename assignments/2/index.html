    Greetings! I am Angel Sandoval, a student at San Francisco State University. I am currently in my senior year at SFSU. I came to SFSU to major in computer science. I was always fascinated by how video games worked. So when I learned I can become a coder and write my own games, I decided to focus on computer science. Yet, my experience with it is limited. I only truly started to code about a year ago. The only language I know is Java as I used it on the IDE:Intellij. I strive to be able to create games that not only I like but others do as well. Along side that, Being able to work at home/anywhere would be nice. So I would not have to worry about vacations/lack of them. My hobby is playing video games.
