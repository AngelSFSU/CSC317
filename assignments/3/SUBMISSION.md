## Individual Reflections

### [Angel Sandoval] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
The handwritten verison of the css was fairly standard. Considering, that the whole group divided the work into three sections. I handled the first five parts. Starting from the body and ending in main. The process was fun, and the brainstorming was productive.

### [Member 2 Name] - Hand-written CSS (Part 2)
[Individual reflection on lessons learned and contribution to hand-written CSS]

### [James Muhlenbruch] - AI Text Prompt CSS
I found the Ai text promp CSS portion to be fairly easy, and was actually nice to manipulate
when I wanted to change something and wanted the AI to change. It also helped a lot when comparing to the others AI CSS as all three of ours was different and gave us alot of things to choose from when making our hybrid.
