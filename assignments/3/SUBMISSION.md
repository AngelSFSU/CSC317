## Individual Reflections

### [Angel Sandoval] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
The handwritten portion was this assignment was rather standard. As our group divided the work into three parts. I did the first, which included starting from the body and ending in main. This was fun, and the brainstorming was productive.

### [David Gomez] - Hand-written CSS (Part 2)
The handwritten section was interesting because it was just an amalgamation of all of us working together. We had fun with the idea and decided what if we all just choose our own styles. The proccess was a bunch of what about this and this, let's just see what happens.dg

### [James Muhlenbruch] - AI Text Prompt CSS
I found the Ai text promp CSS portion to be fairly easy, and was actually nice to manipulate
when I wanted to change something and wanted the AI to change. It also helped a lot when comparing to the others AI CSS as all three of ours was different and gave us alot of things to choose from when making our hybrid.
