# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)
When writting the html we took heavy inspirtation from assignment 2. We simply added sections for each member and if we needed to add more we came together to add what was needed. In the handwritten version, it was an amalgamation of all of working together but seperately. It was just a constant porcess of why don't we do this and why not? In the end we agreed that the handwritten css is quite unappeakling. The AI prompted version were more organized in our individual visions. Angel went for a more american color scheme approach, David went for a more cooler color and vibrant approach, and James had a more darker proffesional asthetic. They all came out well and we liked a few things from each. The group preferred David's colors and liked the extra details that James' had. We collaborated well and had some struggles regarding the switcher. We got some of the jist thatnks to the proffesor for proividing the switcher, but getting to properly work and switch was a issue. Luckily after some time we got it to work. Another time consuming part was implementing the image. Wwe had to changfe the size, file type and structure. We weren't expierenced in implementing but overall we got it and it came well. Overall though this was a good expierence for the group and we learned a lot. The group worked really well with each other and we all did our part into maing it work, with the work splitting up quite evenly. 

## Individual Reflections

### [Angel Sandoval] - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
The handwritten portion was this assignment was rather standard. As our group divided the work into three parts. I did the first, which included starting from the body and ending in main. This was fun, and the brainstorming was productive.

### [David Gomez] - Hand-written CSS (Part 2)
The handwritten section was interesting because it was just an amalgamation of all of us working together. We had fun with the idea and decided what if we all just choose our own styles. The proccess was a bunch of what about this and this, let's just see what happens.dg

### [Angel Sandoval] - AI Text Prompt CSS
The AI portion of this assignment was easy. All I had to do was copy and paste the AI section of the assignemnt into Gemini. The only hands on I had to do is tell the AI what I wanted the portfolio to look like. I chose red, white, and blue as the theme.

### [David Gomez] - AI Text Prompt CSS
The AI portion was easy but I liked the output. I used chatgpt and gave it a very simple prompt. What is gave me was honestly better than I expected, even though my prompt wasn't too specific. My theme was more of a cool color theme, with blue and purple as the highlight since I like darker backgrounds, but with nice colors.

### [James Muhlenbruch] - AI Text Prompt CSS
I found the Ai text promp CSS portion to be fairly easy, and was actually nice to manipulate
when I wanted to change something and wanted the AI to change. It also helped a lot when comparing to the others AI CSS as all three of ours was different and gave us alot of things to choose from when making our hybrid.


## Group Preferred Version
The group preferred ai 2 css due to the colors, we also liked the hover feature found in ai 3 css. Honorable mention being ai 1 css, as it looked like a DMV/GOV site.

## Collaboration Experience
For everything that went on in the assignment, we made a group call and worked together splitting it up into parts for all 3 of us to work simultaneously. The biggest challenge was implementing the switcher, as for a while when it finally showed on the page, the buttons weren't working. I think we all worked pretty well as a team and we learned that it can be fun when we all have a direction of how each of us need to contribute, and we all did end up having fun implementing everything.
