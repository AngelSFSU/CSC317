### [David Gomez] - Hand-written CSS (Part 2)

### [James Muhlenbruch] - AI Text Prompt CSS
I found the Ai text promp CSS portion to be fairly easy, and was actually nice to manipulate
when I wanted to change something and wanted the AI to change. It also helped a lot when comparing to the others AI CSS as all three of ours was different and gave us alot of things to choose from when making our hybrid.
